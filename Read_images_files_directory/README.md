# Read all files in a directory and separate them  from an image file


This repository :
- The image itself is saved in its own name and with the extension png in the results folder. That is, if we have  an image called 1.jpg in the images folder, the same image as 1.png will be saved in the results folder

- For each image in the images folder, create a text file in the results folder with the same name as the image (for example 1.txt) and write:
	I am an image. 
	My name is 1.jpg
